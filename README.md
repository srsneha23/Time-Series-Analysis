# Time-Series-Analysis
The prediction of a stock market direction may serve as an early recommendation system for
short-term investors and as an early financial distress warning system for long-term
shareholders. Forecasting accuracy is the important factor in selecting any forecasting
methods. Research efforts in improving the accuracy of forecasting models are increasing
since the last decade. The appropriate stock selections those are suitable for investment is a
very difficult task. The key factor for each investor is to earn maximum profit on their
investments. In this project Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used. SVM is a specific type
of learning algorithm characterized by the capacity control of the decision function, the use
of the kernel functions and the scarcity of the solution. In this project, there is an
investigation to predict the financial movement with SVM. To evaluate the forecasting
ability of SVM, a comparison is done with Decision Trees and for breaking the barrier of the
difficulty in understanding the financial data, they are visualised using data visualisation
techniques and R. Time series data visualisation plays an important role in all sector of
business decision making. With enormous amount of complex data from cloud and business
requirement, number of graphs needed for decision making increased many folds. These
methods are applied on 2 years of data retrieved from yahoo finance. The results will be used
to analyse the stock prices and their prediction in depth.
